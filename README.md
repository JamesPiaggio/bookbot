# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

# What it does
Simple Python-based bot application built as part of Boot.dev coursework to practice core programming concepts in Python (control flow, modules, I/O, data processing). It accepts a book and returns how many words and characters are in the book. It also has a search feature for its existing library.
